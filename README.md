Converts UNBIS Thesaurus SDF files to SKOS Core

It's a fairly straightforward script.  

Steps:

1.  Split the SDF file into individual temporary files.
2.  Convert the temporary files into JSON formatted files to ease in processing and code re-use.
3.  Map the JSON files to enable term lookups.
4.  SKOSify the JSON files, scraping http://lib-thesaurus.un.org to create URIs.

Probably there are other things that can be done with this, especially in the area of categorization.  While the SKOS that has been generated by this script is nominally compliant (as in, it is good SKOS, and can be read by programs that read SKOS), it is not a perfect representation of the hierarchies by which the Thesaurus is organized.

I am no longer including a full SDF file with this script.  It is available by request if you use the contact links on the UNBIS Thesaurus website, linked above.  Similarly, requests for SKOS formatted XML extracts of the Thesaurus should go through the same contact method.
